                       draft-saa-ali-quic-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the QUIC transport protocol
   (RFC 9000) to enable mid-connection server-side migration.  It
   defines a new QUIC frame, the SERVER_ALTERNATE_ADDRESS frame,
   allowing servers to dynamically advertise alternate IP addresses to
   clients.  This extension supports use cases such as privacy-
   preserving address rotation, censorship circumvention, and mid-
   connection load balancing, expanding beyond the one-time preferred
   address feature defined in RFC 9000.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC [QUIC] supports connection migration, allowing endpoints to
   change addresses (IP address and Port) while preserving connection
   continuity.  Client Migrations, wherein a client might need to
   perform a connection migration, are supported at any time during the
   connection and after the handshake.  However, Server Migrations,
   where a client may connect to a different server address, are limited
   to a one-time redirection using the \texttt{preferred_address}
   transport parameter sent during the handshake.  There is currently no
   mechanism to migrate a connection to a different server address mid-
   connection.

   This document proposes a protocol extension enabling servers to
   dynamically announce alternate addresses during an active connection
   through the \texttt{SERVER_ALTERNATE_ADDRESS} frame.  This explicit
   signaling facilitates server-directed client migration to alternate
   server addresses, enabling use-cases like privacy-preserving address
   rotation, censorship circumvention, and mid-connection load
   balancing.

   One of the design goals for this proposal is to be minimally
   invasive.  It introduces a single new frame type and reuses existing
   QUIC migration mechanisms.  The aim is to maintain compatibility with
   existing protocol implementations and ease the path toward adoption.
